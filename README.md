# Neovim Config

## Description
This is my nvim conifg file. It is of note that I use windows, but I enabled WSL so I'm using Ubuntu as this was the only way I could get neovim to play nice with windows.

## Installation
``` Clone this repository in the appropriate directory. on mac or linux, you can clone this into ~/.config. If you are on a windows, I highly recommend enabling wsl with ubuntu for using neovim. I was unable to get neovim to play nice with windows otherwise. However, if you'd like to give it a shot, clone this repository in your root directory. On Windows, it looks for init.vim in ~/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim. If you do this, you will need to change the file paths in the init.vim by removing the .config from the file paths.  ```

## Usage
When you clone the repo, start nvim and type `:P` and then use tab to get to `:PlugInstall` and select enter.
